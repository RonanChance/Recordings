        <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br />
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <br />
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br />
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br />
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— <br />
            Only this and nothing more.” <br />
 <br />
    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <br />
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <br />
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow <br />
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— <br />
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— <br />
            Nameless here for evermore. <br />
 <br />
    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br />
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br />
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br />
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— <br />
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— <br />
            This it is and nothing more.” <br />
 <br />
    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br />
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br />
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <br />
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br />
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— <br />
            Darkness there and nothing more. <br />
 <br />
    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, <br />
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; <br />
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, <br />
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” <br />
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”— <br />
            Merely this and nothing more. <br />
 <br />
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, <br />
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. <br />
    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; <br />
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— <br />
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— <br />
            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!” <br />
 <br />
    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, <br />
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; <br />
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; <br />
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— <br />
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door— <br />
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more. <br />
 <br />
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, <br />
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, <br />
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, <br />
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore— <br />
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” <br />
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, <br />
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; <br />
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being <br />
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— <br />
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, <br />
            With such name as “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only <br />
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. <br />
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— <br />
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before— <br />
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.” <br />
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, <br />
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store <br />
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster <br />
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— <br />
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore <br />
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.” <br />
 <br />
    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, <br />
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; <br />
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking <br />
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— <br />
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore <br />
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing <br />
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; <br />
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining <br />
    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, <br />
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, <br />
            She shall press, ah, nevermore! <br />
 <br />
    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer <br />
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. <br />
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee <br />
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; <br />
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” <br />
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!— <br />
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, <br />
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted— <br />
    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore— <br />
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!” <br />
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! <br />
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore— <br />
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, <br />
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore— <br />
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” <br />
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting— <br />
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! <br />
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! <br />
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! <br />
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” <br />
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br />
 <br />
    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting <br />
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; <br />
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, <br />
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; <br />
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor <br />
            Shall be lifted—nevermore!</p>

<p>— Edgar Allan Poe</p>
