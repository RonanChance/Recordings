Happy birthday to my dearest honey üéÇ

There have been 7,670 days since you were born. We have been together 449 of those days, or about ~5.85% of your life (so far). 

The past 1.23 years have offered profound growth for me. I found the most loving, devoted, and beautiful girl of my dreams. But I've also faced the most humbling, painful, and unrelenting sickness. I never imagined that small-town life in ~~Pelican Town~~ CW would be so dramatic.  

<br>
<span style="color:Lavender"> Years from now, our past will be a story ‚Äì </span>

<span style="color:Lavender">A story of long days and lonely nights,</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">Hard work and lack of sleep.</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">We‚Äôll live each day having intimately known</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">The pain of being apart,</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">We‚Äôll appreciate and embrace our time together,</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">Knowing how lucky we are</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">To have made it through,</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">And we‚Äôll find solace in</span>

<span style="color:Lavender">The promise of a future together.</span>

<br>
We have made countless memories since we first met. They are what got me through the toughest moments when you were away. 

Your birthday gifts this year are intended to craft memorable moments while we recover, help us reflect on our journey thus far, and prepare our souls for the odyssey ahead. 

I love you, and I wish you the luckiest of birthdays. ‚ù§Ô∏è
