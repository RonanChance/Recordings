All day I hear the noise of waters \\
Making moan, \\
Sad as the sea-bird is when, going \\
Forth alone, \\
He hears the winds cry to the water's \\
Monotone. \\
 \\
The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing \\
Where I go. \\
I hear the noise of many waters \\
Far below. \\
All day, all night, I hear them flowing \\
To and fro.

â€” James Joyce
