In the dark pine—wood\\
I would we lay,\\
In deep cool shadow\\
At noon of day.
 
How sweet to lie there,\\
Sweet to kiss,\\
Where the great pine—forest\\
Enaisled is!
 
Thy kiss descending\\
Sweeter were\\
With a soft tumult\\
Of thy hair.
 
O unto the pine—wood\\
At noon of day\\
Come with me now,\\
Sweet love, away

— James Joyce
