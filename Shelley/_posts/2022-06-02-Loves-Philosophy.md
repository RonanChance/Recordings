The fountains mingle with the river\\
   And the rivers with the ocean,\\
The winds of heaven mix for ever\\
   With a sweet emotion;\\
Nothing in the world is single;\\
   All things by a law divine\\
In one spirit meet and mingle.\\
   Why not I with thine?—

See the mountains kiss high heaven\\
   And the waves clasp one another;\\
No sister-flower would be forgiven\\
   If it disdained its brother;\\
And the sunlight clasps the earth\\
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea:\\
What is all this sweet work worth\\
   If thou kiss not me?

— Percy Shelley
