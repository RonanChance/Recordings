When passion’s trance is overpast, \\
If tenderness and truth could last, \\
Or live, whilst all wild feelings keep \\
Some mortal slumber, dark and deep, \\
I should not weep, I should not weep! \\
 \\
It were enough to feel, to see, \\
Thy soft eyes gazing tenderly, \\
And dream the rest–and burn and be \\
The secret food of fires unseen, \\
Couldst thou but be as thou hast been. \\
 \\
After the slumber of the year \\
The woodland violets reappear; \\
All things revive in field or grove, \\
And sky and sea, but two, which move \\
And form all others, life and love.

— Percy Shelley
